I was laid off from Etsy in August 2018. I was burned out and couldn't performed the required tasks as an IC at Etsy. I remember this cycle of overcompensation by continuing to work through lack of energy.Even though I was not new to failure, the shock of losing my career that I've worked so hard to built up was too great for me at the time.

After I got laid off, I was in denial and kept trying to apply to jobs with this negative attitude. I was displacing my negative feelings towards my job search. I couldn't admit and get past my failure. The one interview that is stuck in my memory was at an onsite Interview with Google in 2019. I remember giving compilable,optimized solutions to one of my dream companies but I had no interest or passion in the moment. 

After this event, I started to expand my hunt for new passions. From becoming a coffee connoisseur to starting a ASMR channel on Youtube, I realize that it is ok to not be sure what you want to do. Not only did this sabbatical allow me to learn new skills, I have been able to question and affirm my own values. 

As I write this blog today, I'm finally coming to peace with everything that has happened and I'm ready to start over. I've finally started to open my heart to engineering and people by coding with technologies that I enjoy. Working with golang, kubernetes, and docker has reignited my passion in engineering. Along with passion, I have bought my own values to my job search. I want to believe in the company's mission that I work with. 

Fighting.
